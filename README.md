# This repository contains the final project of Team 11 in the Fall quarter iteration of ECE 180D course at the University of California, San Diego

## This repository contains four jupyter notebooks that helped us make the code:
Map.ipynb walks through the upload of the dataset to the ArcGIS server.
SpatialDataframes_for_each_crime_category.ipynb uploads multiple dataframes for the server.
Filter data.ipynb count and breaks down the data into bins.
TopCrimesHourlyBarPlots.ipynb plots the bar charts.
