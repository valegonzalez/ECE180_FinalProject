# This repository contains the final project of Team 11 in the Fall quarter iteration of Programming for Data Analysis course at the University of California, San Diego

## This repository contains four jupyter notebooks that helped us make the code:
* Map.ipynb walks through the upload of the dataset to the ArcGIS server.
* SpatialDataframes_for_each_crime_category.ipynb uploads multiple dataframes for the server.
* Filter data.ipynb count and breaks down the data into bins.
* TopCrimesHourlyBarPlots.ipynb plots the bar charts.
