    "# Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "These samples demonstrate various features of the ArcGIS Python API. The samples are categorized by the user profile they are most relevant to. Each sample is in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html), that can be viewed online, or downloaded and run interactively. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Download and run the sample notebooks\n",
    "To run the sample notebooks locally, you need the ArcGIS Python API installed on your computer. See the [Getting Started](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/Install-and-set-up/) section in the Guide to learn how to download and run the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the API is installed, you can download the samples either as an [archive](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api/archive/v0.3-beta.zip) or clone the [arcgis-python-api](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api) GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, extract the archive if you downloaded as an archive then open your terminal application and enter the directory with the samples. Then start Jupyter notebook application. Refer to [Using the Jupyter Notebook environment](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/Using-the-Jupyter-Notebook-environment) tutorial in the Guide for instructions on how to do this and to get yourself familiar with the notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of sample notebooks\n",
    "The sample notebooks contain Python code along with narrative text and rich media (images, videos, widgets, etc). The output from code execution is captured and presented along with the code, using rich media representations. This makes the notebook format a great way to record the steps of your analysis, and present and share the results of your analysis with others.\n",
